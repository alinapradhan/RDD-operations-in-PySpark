# ETDS-RDD-
 This notebook demonstrates basic RDD operations using PySpark, including transformations and actions. It serves as a foundational exercise for understanding distributed data processing in Apache Spark
# ETDS 2 Practical 1 - RDD Operations in PySpark

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for **Practical 1** of the subject **ETDS 2**, focusing on working with **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)** using **Apache Spark and PySpark**.

## 📚 Description

The notebook demonstrates the creation, transformation, and actions on RDDs using PySpark. It provides examples of basic RDD operations such as:

- Creating RDDs from data
- Performing transformations (`map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, etc.)
- Actions (`collect`, `count`, `reduce`, etc.)
- Understanding lazy vs eager evaluation
- Combining RDDs

This practical aims to build a foundational understanding of distributed data processing using Spark's low-level API.
